# Coffee Talk

Not so much a solver, as a series of cheat sheets. Keep these open as you're
playing, so you can easily mix the drinks that the characters request in
challenge mode.

There are currently two lists:

* Coffee Drinks by Name: alphabetical listing of drinks

* Coffee Drinks by Attribute: how to figure out what to give characters when
  they ask for "COOL" or "NOT SWEET" drinks
