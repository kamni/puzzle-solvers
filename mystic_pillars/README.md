# Mystic Pillars

[Mystic Pillars](https://holycowprod.com/portfolio/mystic-pillars/) is this
awesome little indie game, where you have to go from village to village solving
puzzles to unblock the water supply.

The puzzles take the form of a stone-shifting game: within the alotted number
of moves, shift the stones around to match the provided key. There's a catch,
however. You can only shift the number of stones that represents the distance
that the stones are being shifted.

So if you're moving the stones to a neighboring pillar, then only one stone
gets moved at a time. If you move to a pillar that is located 2 connections
away, then 2 get moved, and so on.
