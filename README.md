# Puzzle Solver

Who doesn't love puzzle games?

But sometimes I get stuck on one particular puzzle, and I don't want to look
at a walkthrough guide online -- because that just takes out the fun of
solving the puzzle.

But it's still solving the puzzle if you write code to solve it!

So here's where I keep various puzzle solvers that I write to solve in-game
puzzles.


## Prerequisites

All puzzle solutions assume Python 3.5+.


## Warning

In most cases these are quick, throwaway scripts that were written out to serve
a very specific game's needs; these are not polished libraries, and not
necessarily user-friendly. They don't always have good error handling for
unexpected inputs or unsolvable problems.

Whenever possible, I have tried to leave instructions to my future self and
others on how to use the scripts, but I may have forgotten or the directions
might be wrong because I did't come back and test/update the instructions after
I made changes.

In other words, YMMV.
